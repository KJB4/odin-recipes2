    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter 2 gratin dishes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook lobster tails in skillet until slightly golden and about halfway cooked-through, about 2 minutes per side. 
            Transfer tails to a plate to rest. When cool enough to handle, remove lobster meat from shells and chop meat. Reserve shells.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour; cook and stir until a paste forms and flour taste cooks off, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Add cold milk to flour mixture; whisk until completely incorporated. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low, and stir in paprika, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. 
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Season sauce with salt.</li>
        <li>Stir Cheddar cheese and Gruyere cheese into milk mixture until cheese is melted. Remove from heat and stir Worcestershire sauce into cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water with reserved lobster tails and a pinch of salt to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
            until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Remove and discard lobster shells, drain pasta.</li>
        <li>Stir macaroni into cheese sauce with thyme leaves. Divide macaroni mixture between the 2 prepared gratin dishes. Top macaroni with chopped lobster meat, '
            poking meat down into macaroni mixture with a fork.</li>
        <li>Stir bread crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl. Add Parmesan cheese and stir. Top each gratin dish with bread crumb mixture.</li>
