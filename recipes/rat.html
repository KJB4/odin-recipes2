    <h2 class="rat">Descriptions</h2>

    <p class="hello"> A seasoned stew made of eggplant, tomatoes, green peppers, squash, and sometimes meat. 
        Ratatouille is a rustic southern French vegetable stew made with eggplant, bell peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, onions, and tomatoes. 
        In some versions, the vegetables are combined and cooked together for a long period of time until they practically melt. 
        Its official French name is Ratatouille Niçoise. The traditional recipe calls for tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, peppers and onions. ... 
        As mentioned abovethe veggies can simply be “rough cut” and tossed in with some olive oil and herbs all together to create a tomato stew to serve along with a starchy something. 
        If you make true ratatouille, you distinctly taste the eggplant, the tomatoes and the other ingredients with each bite. Ratatouille can accompany almost any kind of meat, poultry or seafood. 
        It's particularly wonderful alongside an omelet for lunch.</p>
